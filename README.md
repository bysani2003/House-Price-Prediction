# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning technique that can be used for predicting numerical values based on input features. In this project, we'll be using historical data of house prices along with relevant features to train a linear regression model and then use it to predict house prices for new data.

## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a common problem in the field of real estate and finance. By building a linear regression model, we can create a predictive tool that provides estimates of house prices based on certain features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](link-to-your-dataset). It includes various features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Square footage
- Location
- Age of the house
- ...

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need to have the following installed:
- Python (version X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the provided notebook)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

2. Download the dataset from [here](link-to-your-dataset) and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

Follow these steps to train and use the linear regression model:

1. Open the `house_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the notebook cells to train the model on the dataset.
3. Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model's predictions align with the actual house prices in the dataset.

## Results

Provide some insights into the model's performance and predictions. You can include visualizations like scatter plots comparing predicted vs. actual prices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
